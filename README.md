## Amorus is an app designed to find the probability of finding lovers

## Users in the app form a graph where: 
  <ul>
  <li> Since love/amor spreads like a virus, the overall app is a blending of the words amor and virus -> <a href= "http://elijahhuang.com" target = "_blank"> <strong><em>Amorus</em></strong> </a> </li>
  <li> Each user is a vertex </li>
  <li> Users are connected via edges based on where they live, where they go, and their common interests </li>
  <li> The strength of interaction between users it determined by a linear regression model for each user that outputs a compatability score </li>
  <li>The interactions from each user propagates throughout the graph (person A becomes friends with person B via common friend C) </li>
  <li> Through modeling this spread, Amorus is able to determine the chance of meeting soulmates (Those with a high compatability score determined by Lin Reg) </li>
  </ul>
