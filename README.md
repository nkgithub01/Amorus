## Amorus is an app designed to find the probabilities of connecting with other potential lovers.
## Users in the app form a graph where:
  ### - Each user is a vertex
  ### - Users are connected via edges based on where they live, where they go, and their common interests
  ### - The strength of interaction between users it determined by a linear regression model
  ###   for each user that outputs a compatability score
  ### - The interactions from each user propagates throughout the graph (person A becomes friends with person B via common friend C)
  ###  - Since love/amor spreads like a virus, the overall app is a blending of the words amor and virus -> **__Amorus__**
